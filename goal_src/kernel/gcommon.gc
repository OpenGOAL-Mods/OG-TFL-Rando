;; The "identity" returns its input unchanged.  It uses the special GOAL "object"
;; type, which can basically be anything, so this will work on integers, floats,
;; strings, structures, arrays, etc.  The only things which doesn't work with "object"
;; is a 128-bit integer. The upper 64-bits of the integer will usually be lost.
